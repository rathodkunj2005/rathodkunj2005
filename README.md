## 🧠 About Me

I’m an early-career AI developer building full-stack applications at the intersection of **AI, cloud, and healthcare/legal tech**.  
From HIPAA-conscious hospital LLM interfaces to legal AI benchmarks, I specialize in solving real-world problems with high-performance AI systems.

## 🛠️ Experience

### 💻 Software Development Intern, AI Services – University of Utah (SUDO)  
*Jan 2025 – Present*  
- Co-built a secure, HIPAA-conscious chat platform for hospital staff to interact with LLMs grounded on internal data  
- Built React-based frontend and scalable AWS backends (Lambda, S3, Bedrock) for dynamic LLM selection and file uploads  
- Reduced LLM inference latency by **40%** and improved retrieval query speed by **60%** via caching + DB optimizations  
- Enabled real-time interactions with hospital data through a secure, fault-tolerant infrastructure
  
### 🧑🏽‍🔬 Undergraduate Researcher – AI & Aerospace Materials - STARS Lab, University of Utah
*Aug 2025 – Present*                         Collaborations with NASA, MIT, Microsoft, DoD
- Advancing AI-driven materials discovery by developing ML pipelines for high-throughput experimentation,
computational modeling, and aerospace materials design.
- Integrating large language models (LLMs) and multi-agent AI systems to streamline knowledge sharing,
automate literature mining, and enhance decision support across interdisciplinary research teams.
- Collaborating with cross-domain experts in computer science and materials engineering to design AI workflows
that accelerate research in rocket engines, hypersonics, and in-space manufacturing.

### ⚖️ AI Engineering Intern – CourtEasy.ai  
*Nov 2024 – Apr 2025*  
- Processed and structured **10M+ Indian legal documents** across statutes, orders, and metadata  
- Built **task-specific RAG pipelines** improving retrieval accuracy by **28%** and reducing hallucinations by **35%**  
- Benchmarked LLMs (InLegalBERT, InLegalLLaMA, GPT-4o-mini) across 20+ tasks using LegalBench, NyayaAnumana, etc.  
- Synthesized 15+ research papers into internal strategy docs for legal AI design and evaluation
